"""
Define RPG classes and their tier progression.

Tier 1 classes are imported from the CSV file and have no level requirement.
Tier 2 classes upgrade Tier 1 classes, Tier 3 classes upgrade Tier 2 classes,
and Tier 4 classes upgrade Tier 3 classes. Some classes are only available
after specific classes have been selected.
